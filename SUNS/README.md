# Steerable Ultrasonic Nerve Stimulator (SUNS)

> Development of a closed-loop device that stimulates superficial peripheral nerves using focused ultrasound and traditional electrical stimulation.

---

## Overview

- **Goal:** Combine focused ultrasound (FUS) with traditional e-stim to create a steerable, non-invasive nerve stimulator.  
- **Funding:** SOURCE STEM Research funding (Summer 2025).  
- **Status:** Early prototyping, tank testing, and real-time system workflow development.
